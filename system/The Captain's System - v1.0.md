### Versioning Systems
The version control approach for the System uses a standard version BigNumber.LittleNumber approach. Small version updates happen when sub-systems have small addenda and updates. Big changes to the system happen when major components of the system ([[#^0dbbf5 |here]]) change (example - *new tool addition*) 

### Applications & Tools

- Bujoshi Journal
- Analog Timer -- for time-blocking
- Sticky Notes (or Apple Notes) -- for roll-down lists
- Obsidian -- Brain Dump, Memex, and Archive
- Pages / Excel / Sheets - Trackers and Master Index
### Master Index
All important bujoshi pages, external application notes, and other important items should be added to the master index.
### Bujoshi
1. Markers
2. Modules
#### *Markers* 
![[IMG_3529 2.png|378x309]]
#### *Modules*
##### Index
- Each bujoshi should be appended with a free-standing page to act as a table of contents.  
##### Future Log
- 2-page spread with monthly blocks
- 1-page with a list of running tasks that haven't necessarily been assigned anywhere 
##### Progress Log
- 1-page with visual review on the left 
	- should be split between Symby and personal devas
- Tasks for the next season on the right 
	- again, should be split between Symby and personal devas
	- For each, cover the four primary goals + 10 tactics to get to said goals.
##### Monthly Log
- 2-page spread
	- Calendar on the left 
	- Four goals for Symby and personal on the left, along with the ten tactics each.
##### Weekly Log
- 2-page spread 
	- The first page should feature for the week per category (symby, personal)
	- The second page should feature the weekly, by-day breakdown of tasks that are timed.
##### Daily Log
- logs of daily work and notes
- Logs should allow for maximum **==8 total tasks per day==**. This eight total tasks must be shared amongst each of the three task categories (personal, technology, business) depending on which require the most attention per day.
##### Unit Reviews
- You'll want reviews to be more robust in content and units of time reviewed. Reviews should generally exist for every unit of time beyond a week - weekly reviews should be a two-page spread.
	- On weekly spread:
		- First page should allow me to leave comments about quality of each day
		- Second page should allow leaving comments about the week at large.
- Reviews should be robust and detailed so that the System can be updated in trials by fire!
- Reviews can be free-form but should generally ask these questions:
	- What went well?
	- What went wrong (is this an old or new problem)?
	- What experiment will we conduct to fix any sticky, non-event-specific problems?
	- Where are we with the goals from this unit?
##### Finance Log
- You can produce these for every couple of weeks
- Should feature goals, upcoming spend, new subscriptions, and money in wait
- Also should feature ample space for running notes that month
#### *Bujoshi Tips*
- Events and tasks that need to be scheduled outside of the current month should go to the future log.
	- Even if you know a new task will need to be migrated or in the future log, at the moment it arises, just add to the daily log and migrate it later.
- Use threading to relate pages and books.
	- Example: 
		- current-page/next-page (`51/10`)
		- Book.Page (`2.14`)
- Task Tips:
	- **Do the boring stuff FIRST and earliest in the day.**
	- Establish an order to task lists rather than having them randomly scattered. Importance should count (especially on critical tasks), but consider what will allow you to complete the most work. Tasks should be prioritized by:
		- Importance
		- Unpleasantness
		- Time to Completion
		- Example: *Important-Task-A is hours; Less-Important-Task-B is 5 minutes; B should come before A.*
	- Stalled tasks (>=3 days migrated) receive red carpet treatment and are automatically moved to critical completion *OR* they must be future-logged.
	- Try to guess how much time will be allocated towards tasks. This will allow us to fill out and refine our delusion delta tracker.
	
### Practices 
##### *Tri-Monthly*
- Review the progress log.
- Prepare the next season's progress log.
- Review deva offerings and tracker statistics.
- Fill out the unit review for the season.
- Write the red letters to yourself! It'll be cool to have a casual conversation with yourself in the future. 
##### *Monthly*
- Collate and review the hanging tasks from the previous month and future log.
- Review bujoshi calendar to understand upcoming responsibilities for the month.
- Create the new monthly log.
- Fill out the unit review for the month.
##### *Weekly*
- Review the system overview and make updates.
- Collate and review the hanging tasks from the previous week. Ensure all are marked done and added to the local + master index.
- Take 30 minutes to develop plan for the upcoming week.
- Update the finance log and budget.
- Look at aggregated tracker statistics.
- Create new weekly log.
- Fill out the unit review for the week.
##### *Daily*
- Take 5 minutes to review the weekly plan.
- Do AM reflection, resulting in a plan for the day based on needs.
- Do PM reflection: before bed do two things:
	- Update the daily trackers.
	- Scan the daily log and migrate any items that need it.
### Trackers 
#### *Health Tracker*
#### *Punctuation Tracker*
#### *Human Tracker*
#### *Productivity Tracker*
#### *Deva Tracker*

### Time Blocks
###### **On Time Blocking**
- A block of time
	- makes up tasks, which be at most 3 blocks per task. 
	- are 25 minutes of uninterrupted work time. 
- If you have any interruptions (check email/Slack, get up to sign for a package, get a drink), that block gets nuked. 
- The algorithm for a block of work should look like the following:
	- Choose a task.
	- Picture what it's like to finish that task.
	- Mark down completed block in the house.
	- Take a 5-minute break.
	- Repeat and refine.
- For tasks, you should use a Roll-Down list with sticky notes or Apple Notes to keep yourself on track with the granular items that are entailed in your larger task.
###### **Time Types**
- **Buffer**: 1 hour of the day to do unexpected new tasks that can or should get done soon
- **Tool-Up**: 15 minutes needed to update Linear (task management system)
- **Strategic**: 3 hour blocks for uninterrupted heads down work

### The Punctuations
There's some useful in defining parts of your core curiosities, especially if you have too many interests or hobbies. Punctuations are an attempt to do that.

### Communications Strategy
#### *Email*
**Inbox Bankruptcy**
Implement inbox bankruptcy for when your emails get out of control. Use this algorithm for inbox bankruptcy:
1. Manually go through 3 months of email backlog and make manual deletions, archives, etc.
2. For even older build-up, bulk archive these OR export the bulk MBOX files. 
3. After archiving, implement a system for searching along these files if you ever need to revisit them in the future.
4. Enjoy your clean inbox!
