		- Distant Light 🍴🍪 (WTO)
			- A wonderful fairytale for those uncertain; has a lot of to say about death, the risk of trying only to be shut down, and the inevitably of nature - but in such a light voice. Unique voice and reads like a dream; really enjoy the framing of death as the distant light, and a return to the child we once were

		- Reading + Info Overload 🍴🥘
			- A note on the information overload paper, I had a few good things come out of this, primarily, three that I can think of at the top of my head. I'm just going to bullet point them first so that can get back to them. One, Newton may have been one of the first dog ears or, you know, to dog your pages, which is kind of interesting. Two, I got a really good quote from Francis Bacon that essentially goes some books are to be tasted, some are to be chewed and some are to be digested. I really like that one as a quote, but two as also a useful scale for how I'm probably going to review books and how I prioritize said books when I actually have the blog up and running. The third thing that I wanted to mention was that this paper also really discussed an interesting evolution of how we look at knowledge status. So they mentioned, I believe Seneca and Plutarch, but maybe, I think Plutarch was maybe taking inspiration from Seneca. I have to check back on this with the paper anyway, Seneca or Plutarch pensions that they think an abundance of books is silly, or to have an abundance of books that you don't read is silly. The better thing is to have a quick selection of books that you have that you can return to for the most useful information over and over again, and to encourage the action of going to other books more as scouting, rather than just reading for leisure, or, you know, constantly looking for new information from other books. This is interesting because in the paper, also says that, of course, later on, the evolution is the number of books. And you can even see in art how in paintings or in representations of scholars, you go from they have one book open that they're intentional about to these representations of scholars and artistic pieces where they have many books and they're surrounded by knowledge, papers, pens, you name it, the thought about knowledge status itself at that time is also like, how many books are you imbibing essentially as a Part of hard study. So that's interesting. It's interesting to me because I think now there's more of an evolution toward, away from even number of books, and maybe one can argue that still around, but I don't think so, and more so toward the selection of books themselves, right? And I don't think it's in the same way that Seneca says that you have a selection of books that you constantly reread, I think these are a selection of books where, even if you haven't read them, they signal sub cultural belonging for that individual and the individuals that they're going to be interacting with. So it's a different sort of knowledge status game. And so I find that evolution particularly interesting to talk about this also makes me want to come up with a better system for how I prioritize knowledge that I perceive from books, whether that's fiction or non fiction. And we obviously know that I read a lot of literary fiction, so I need to think more about that. This paper talks about a lot of note taking practices from, you know, regular, regular notes in a notebook, all the way to the copy and paste phenomena of later on, especially with the rise of like newspaper prints and cheap copies with the printing press, so people had ability to cut and paste. But I really want to come up with a better way to prioritize. Like, for instance, if I take a quote from a book. Why am I taking that quote? I'm taking the Francis Bacon quote from this paper. Specifically. It's my first time hearing it, because I think that it'll inform my relationship with books and how I prioritize not only reading and scouting, I like that word too, but also rereading. And so I want to come up with a system where I basically have a shorthand or markers for types of knowledge that I run into very frequently in books. And maybe that could be like an online mimics that I have as well, like a book breakdown, where my notes on everything that I read are pretty public and prioritized, and have a standard. So, you know, I think that's my sort of takeaway from this big paper I really liked it. Yeah, it was kind of a towards me and I didn't really care about the copy and paste phenomena but I understood the importance of it. So, yep.

### **Analysis of the Quote**

This metaphor elegantly captures the **varying depth and lasting impact** different books have:

- **Tasted**: These are books you sample lightly — perhaps skim or read once — for entertainment, curiosity, or quick information. They’re transient, not deeply engaging, and don’t demand or reward much intellectual effort.
    
- **Chewed**: These are books that engage your attention more thoroughly. You may reread parts, reflect on them, and appreciate their layers. They have complexity and substance, but don’t necessarily alter your worldview.
    
- **Digested**: These books become part of you. They shape your thinking, philosophy, or emotions in lasting ways. They’re internalized — not just read, but _absorbed_

## **Taste (Light or limited engagement)**

Books you might read once, skim, or set aside. Not necessarily bad — just not deep or lasting. Three subcategories:

1. **Entertaining but Disposable**
    
    - E.g. A fun comic, thriller, or romance novel you enjoyed but won’t return to.
        
    - Like literary fast food — enjoyable, but gone quickly.
        
2. **Frustrating or Unenjoyable**
    
    - Books you disliked or couldn’t finish. Maybe poorly written, or just not your taste.
        
    - Includes hate-reads or disappointments.
        
3. **Curiosity-Driven Sampling** (scouting)
    
    - You picked it up out of curiosity — maybe it had a buzz — but it didn’t warrant deeper attention.
        
    - Could be a quick nonfiction read, an experimental genre, etc.

## **Chew (Revisitable, thoughtful engagement)**

Books you engage with more seriously. Worthy of rereading or deeper reflection. Three subcategories:

1. **Intellectually Stimulating**
    
    - Books that present complex ideas, arguments, or insights that require time to unpack.
        
    - You may highlight or annotate passages.
        
2. **Emotionally Resonant but Not Canonical**
    
    - Books that affect you emotionally and stick with you, but may not be life-changing.
        
    - E.g., a beautifully written novel that lingers for months.
        
3. **Rich in Craft or Style**
    
    - Books you return to for their language, form, or structure.
        
    - E.g., poetry collections, stylistically unique prose, or clever genre work.

## **Digest (Transformational or Canon-worthy)**

Books that become part of your mental or emotional framework. Three subcategories:

1. **Worldview-Shaping**
    
    - Books that shift your perspective or philosophy.
        
    - E.g., _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius, _The Second Sex_, _Sapiens_.
        
2. **Identity-Affirming or Disrupting**
    
    - Books that articulate or challenge something essential about your identity or values.
        
    - E.g., coming-of-age stories, memoirs, or books on race, gender, or culture.
        
3. **Endlessly Referable**
    
    - Books you return to repeatedly across life contexts.
        
    - E.g., religious texts, core theoretical works, personal "life manuals."
