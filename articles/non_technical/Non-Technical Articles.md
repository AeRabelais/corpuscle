- 2024-12-26 [The Economy Has Been Great Under Biden. That’s Why Trump Won.](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/the-economy-has-been-great-under-biden-thats-why-trump-won) 
	- Describes an economic model where republicans likely to win when the incumbent economy is good, Democrats when said economy is bad
	- Democrats voted when things are bad because of the prospect of improved safety nets / greater risk aversion; Republicans chosen when less risk aversion
	- “presidential paradox” - Democratic presidencies see higher stock market returns
- 2024-12-14 [Emily Bender - Talking about a ‘schism’ is ahistorical](https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/talking-about-a-schism-is-ahistorical-3c454a77220f) 
	- But this is emphatically not a story of a community that once shared concerns and now is broken into disagreeing camps. Rather, there are two separate threads — only one of which can properly be called a body of scholarship — that are being held up as in conversation or in competition with each other.  I think this forced pairing comes in part from the media trying to fit the recent [AI doomer](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) [PR pushes](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) #quote 
		- She posits that the approach taken by the "AI doomer" crowd is a ploy at grabbing limited attention from policymakers, perhaps to shun addressing modern (actualized) issues with how these systems are currently screwing people 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">2024-12-14</mark> [Vox on Ethics vs Alignment]([https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/10/23298108/ai-dangers-ethics-alignment-present-future-risk](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/10/23298108/ai-dangers-ethics-alignment-present-future-risk)) #ai #ethics #safety  
	- nothing too much of note. posits that AI ethics and AI safety are just the difference between, respectively, short versus long-term concerns. I don't think practitioners apart of the respective fields would agree.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">2024-12-14</mark> [Functional difference between EEG and fMRI](https://medium.com/@neurotist/brain-wars-eeg-vs-fmri-the-battle-for-neuroimaging-supremacy-6de8bc4fec0e) #brain-comp-interface 
	- EEG is better for getting quick, snappy, streaming-data views of brain activity and returns direct electrical activity. Quicker picture
	- fMRI is better for detailed, more spatially resolute high-level overviews of brain activity. Better picture
		- fMRIs don't really look at electrical activity directly; instead, it looks at strongly related processes like blood flow rate to determine where brain activity is happening
		- Advanced fMRI techniques, such as multi-band imaging and higher field strengths, enhance both spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for more detailed and faster scans. These innovations make it possible to study the brain’s intricate dynamics with unprecedented clarity and precision
		- BIG CON: fMRI, on the other hand, requires participants to lie still in a noisy, confined space, which can be uncomfortable and even claustrophobic for some. The need for a strong magnetic field also means that individuals with certain metal implants or devices cannot undergo fMRI scans.
